Problem Set 2

This involves two datasets, one that is the train/valid format, the other a
csv. Extra points for having the most accurately trained neural net.

2.1 Classify Your Car.

You will need to sign up at kaggle.com. It appears this is the way to get ahold

> kaggle datasets download -d jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset

Load up the data, train, then test to see what sort of car you own.


2.2 Digits

Write a number down between 0 and 255. Don't tell yourself what the number is.
Then run:

> kaggle competitions download -c digit-recognizer

This should fail. You have to agree to be part of a competition. See if you can 
identity the number after loading and training.
