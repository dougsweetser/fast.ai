# Problem Set for Lecture 1

## Getting the feet wet

The idea here is to write a few Jupyter notebooks that do a wee bit of work.

### Problem 1.1: Prove your dog or cat is a dog or cat

Recreate one of the models from the first lecture. Upload a picture or two of
your dog or cat. Prove you know your own pet.

### Problem 1.2: Car Versus Chair

Using your cell phone, take a half dozen pictures of cars and chairs. Test if
the software can tell the difference.
