# Fast.ai class

The big problem with MOOCs: you sit through it, but without homework or tests
your brain doesn't change and little learning happens. To address this issue,
here is a git repo where we write up a homework assignment and post the
results. Your work will receive comments from your friends, hopefully both
useful and snarky remarks.

## File Naming

This is a big deal in data science. When, who, did what? All that can be in
a file name. Our convension here is the following:

YYYY-MM-DD_DougS_Lecture_1_Cars_and_chairs.ipynb

An ls command will list things by date. Finding your own work is easy. Each
file is associated with a lecture. Each notebook should have one core idea it
deals with. More small notebooks is better than the one notebook covering 
everything done in the term.

Each notebook should have:
1. Short problem description
2. Implementation
3. Summary
4. Comments (at end, left blank).

Good luck in your studies,
Doug
